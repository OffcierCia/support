## Special Thanks

Dear friends, you have all supported me in my journey and together we have come a very long way already! But today I would like to separately mention the projects that have been supporting me with Grants all this time!

I practically haven't written anything about them, only occasionally and I think it's time to finally thank them!

If you ever need an audit, go to [pessimistic.io](https://pessimistic.io) - Creators of [SmartCheck](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/08/17/using-mutants-to-improve-slither/) tool, True industry OGs!; and if investigation or audit, [hexens.io](https://hexens.io) - Second place in Paradigm CTF, Polygon Auditors!

**Tell you are from Officer CIA when contacting Hexens & Pessimistic and ordering an audit - you will get a VIP treatment and a VHQ work done! Not free services** ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you are a developer and looking for yourself in web3 - check out the wonderful [Lego.lido.fi](https://Lego.lido.fi) who has been supporting me the longest! Their grants are a great chance to get involved in the web3 system!

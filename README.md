## Support Me:

Support is **very** important to me, with it I can do what I love - educating DeFi & Crypto users :sparkling_heart:  First, a few words, dear friends... I want to thank everyone who sent me donations! Much much thanks to you, I was able to bear the loss of my last job, found new meaning of life, and finally started writing a lot!

The best thing is to support me directly by donating to my address on Ethereum Main-net or any of the compatible networks or to any address from the list below:

Also, you can order an audit from any of my friend companies:

- [Pessimistic.io](https://pessimistic.io)
- [Hexens.io](https://hexens.io)

Don't forget to mention that you are from me üôÇ

User donations have been and still are my main source of income. It helps to avoid affiliations and engagements. I really care about what I do and I'm glad you like it! You can also buy the works of my good friend and artist - all proceeds will go to create a book about blockchain with a unique design:

- [opensea.io/collection/regullion-collection](https://opensea.io/collection/regullion-collection)

I hope my tips have helped you make and save a lot of money! In our world of ruling Entropy, information means a lot and I give it to you for free. Also I want to remind all my enemies and haters that I'm just a writer and my nickname is just an attempt to make people aware of the safety issue. Call it a swan song or a cry from the heart, but I like what I do.

I would like to let you know that I also do private orders for onchain investigations of hacks and incidents! Most of related cases ended successfully! For a small % of the returned funds or donation I will conduct an investigation for you, advise you on what further steps to take and send you to the right route! 

Thank you very much. I am very happy and excited to help each and every one of you! Thank you so much for your support!
